# Codex Session Handoff

This file is a local snapshot of the current project state so a new Codex thread can resume work quickly.

Pair this file with:

- `FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT_SPEC.md`
- `PERSISTENT_KNOWLEDGE_THREAD_PROMPT.md`
- `MULTI_THREAD_WORKFLOW.md`
- `THREAD_OWNERSHIP.md`

The handoff file records current state.
The future spec records what still needs to be built next.

## Product scope

- Project: `interview_trainer_desktop`
- Positioning: visible Windows desktop app for mock interviews or clearly disclosed AI-assisted practice
- Explicitly out of scope: hidden overlays, screen-share evasion, recording evasion

## Current architecture

- Desktop shell: Electron + React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python
- Audio: Windows `WASAPI loopback + mic` support, with manual and native session modes
- ASR: chunked transcription and optional OpenAI Realtime bridge
- Answer pipeline:
  - overlap-aware turn manager
  - knowledge routing
  - layered `starter` / `full` answer generation
  - optional streaming `starter`

## Important implemented pieces

- Audio capability probing and recommendation
- Knowledge workspace management
- Audio session manager
- Native audio capture worker path
- Live bridge:
  - `audio session -> ASR -> interview session -> answer`
- Partial transcripts for Realtime ASR
- Adaptive gate + lightweight VAD
- Starter prewarm:
  - interviewer partial transcripts can prewarm a `starter`
  - locked questions can reuse the warmed fast-lane draft instead of always starting cold
  - backend now exposes serialized prewarm state for session/runtime polling
  - desktop UI now shows prewarm status, preview text, and warm-start metrics
- Streaming starter answer state:
  - `pending`
  - `starter_streaming`
  - `starter_ready`
  - `complete`
  - `failed`
- Starter metrics:
  - `starter_stream_ms`
  - `starter_ms`
  - `full_ms`
- Split generation lanes:
  - `fast`
  - `smart`
- Workspace API:
  - create/list/update
  - compile
  - import local project path
- Minimal desktop workspace panel:
  - profile/project/role notes
  - local path import
  - compile and attach to session

## Generation config model

Shared generation env vars still work:

```powershell
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_LLM_API_KEY=...
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_LLM_BASE_URL=...
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_FAST_MODEL=...
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_SMART_MODEL=...
```

Lane-specific overrides are now supported:

```powershell
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_FAST_PROVIDER=template
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_FAST_MODEL=template-fast
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_SMART_PROVIDER=openai
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_SMART_API_KEY=...
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_SMART_BASE_URL=https://subrouter.ai/v1
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_SMART_MODEL=gpt-5.4
set INTERVIEW_TRAINER_SMART_TIMEOUT_S=45
```

Recommended current setup:

- `fast`: template or a genuinely fast compatible model
- `smart`: stronger remote model

## Last real validation results

- Backend tests: `35/35` passing
- Desktop build: `npm run build` passing
- Real compatible generation smoke:
  - provider style: OpenAI-compatible chat completions
  - streaming starter observed
  - example timing:
    - `starter_stream_ms`: about `8102`
    - `starter_ms`: about `12332`
  - `gpt-5.4` is still too slow to be the true fast model
- Mixed lane smoke:
  - `fast=template`
  - `smart=gpt-5.4`
  - immediate starter works
  - `full` may still take longer than short debug windows
- Runtime prewarm regression:
  - partial interviewer transcript now prewarms the starter lane
  - locked question reuses the warmed starter when the partial and final question match
- Runtime prewarm visibility:
  - session responses now include `prewarm`
  - session snapshots include active `prewarms`
  - live bridge responses include `last_prewarm`
  - answer UI marks reused warm starts with `prewarmed starter`

## Known gaps

- Multi-interviewer speaker separation inside the system stream is not implemented
- Minimal workspace UI exists, but richer upload/indexing UX still needs to be built
- Need more real-user testing on:
  - naturalness
  - latency tolerance
  - follow-up consistency
  - project-specific answer quality

## Best next debugging tasks

1. Run the backend locally and verify API endpoints.
2. Run the desktop renderer and confirm UI state transitions.
3. Test one real interview-style question with your own project context.
4. Measure whether starter naturalness and latency are acceptable.
5. Decide whether the next build step should prioritize:
   - upload/indexing
   - answer quality tuning
   - a faster fast-model provider

## Commands

## Bootstrap prompt for a new Codex thread

Use this at the top of a fresh thread:

```text
Please continue from these files:
E:/qqbroDownload/interview_trainer_desktop/CODEX_SESSION_HANDOFF.md
